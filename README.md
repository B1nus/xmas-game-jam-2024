Theme: Woodland Folklore

- christmas folklore?
- trees? forest?

# Idea 1
You are a [skogsrå](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skogsr%C3%A5et) which protects the forest from evil trolls trying to vandilise the trees. (Tower defense)

Simplified:
- [ ] one tree to protect
- [ ] ants attack the tree
- [ ] skogsrå in white robe hovering slightly above ground (so I don't need to do a walking animation)
- [ ] calm song
- [ ] not so calm song (the trolls are attacking)
- [ ] tree hit sound effect
- [ ] magic sound effect (skogsrå)
- [ ] glow/glitter (skogsrå)
- [ ] magic sound when skogsrå hovers around.
- [ ] forest background with paralax

# Notes
- I will make all assets myself. (music, pictures, code, sounds)
- Record your own sounds (fun!)
- Try to make your own song (it's going to be bad but whatever)
- Try to draw/make your own models (it's going to be bad but whatever)
- Webgame.
- 2D
